Microshift 


Main Advantages of Red Hat build of MicroShift
Red Hat build of MicroShift enables you to solve problems for edge devices by:
•	Running the same Kubernetes workloads, you run in the cloud, but at the edge.
•	Overcoming the operational challenge of minimal system resources.
•	Addressing the environmental challenges of severe networking constraints such as low or no connectivity.
•	Meeting the physical constraint of hard-to-access locations by installing your system images directly on edge devices.
•	Building on and integrating with edge-optimized operating systems such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for Edge.
MicroShift has the simplicity of single-node deployment with the functions and services you need for computing in resource-constrained locations. You can have many deployments on different hosts, creating the specific system image needed for each of your applications
